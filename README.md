# Netflix Data Analysis â€” EDA, SQL & Power BI

**Performed comprehensive analysis on the `Netflix shows and movies` dataset using Python (EDA), MySQL (data wrangling & queries), Excel (ad hoc checks), and Power BI (interactive dashboards).**
The analysis uncovers trends in release patterns, genres, ratings, and cast/director insights.

# *Netflix EDA & Data Cleaning* 

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Cleaning** of the Netflix dataset.
The goal is to explore trends, clean messy data, and prepare it for further analysis or machine learning applications.

##  Objectives

* Understand the structure of the Netflix dataset
* Perform data cleaning (handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies)
* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns
* Visualize insights with Python libraries

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including:

* **Title**
* **Director**
* **Cast**
* **Country**
* **Date Added**
* **Release Year**
* **Rating**
* **Duration**
* **Listed in (Genre)**
* **Description**

##  Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values
   * Removed duplicates
   * Standardized column names and formats

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Distribution of content by type (Movies vs TV Shows)
   * Most common genres
   * Trend of content added over the years
   * Country-wise contribution to Netflix library
   * Analysis of ratings and duration

3. **Visualizations**

   * Count plots, bar charts, pie charts
   * Trend analysis with line plots
   * Word cloud for genres/descriptions

##  Key Insights

* Movies dominate the Netflix library compared to TV Shows
* Certain genres (like Drama, International Movies) are highly represented
* The number of new titles peaked in recent years
* USA and India contribute a large share of Netflix content

##  Conclusion

This project provides a clear understanding of Netflix's content library, highlights data cleaning techniques, and showcases insights through EDA.
It serves as a foundation for further projects like recommendation systems or predictive modeling.


# *MySQL Data Analysis* 

# SQL Queries for Netflix Analysis (MySQL 8.0+)

**Assumptions**

* Table name: `netflix`
* Relevant columns: `show_id`, `type`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in`, `description`
* `date_added` may be a string like 'September 9, 2019'. Use `STR_TO_DATE(date_added, '%B %d, %Y')` if necessary.

## Helpful utilities (convert comma-list to rows using JSON_TABLE)

```sql
-- Example: split `listed_in` into rows (works in MySQL 8)
SELECT jt.genre, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM netflix
JOIN JSON_TABLE(
  CONCAT('["', REPLACE(COALESCE(listed_in,''), ', ', '","'), '"]'),
  '$[*]' COLUMNS (genre VARCHAR(255) PATH '$')
) AS jt
GROUP BY jt.genre
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
```
